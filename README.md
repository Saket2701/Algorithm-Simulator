# Algorithm Simulator Website

This is a web application that allows you to visualize and understand several fundamental algorithms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can simulate the following algorithms:

1. **Linear Search**
2. **Binary Search**
3. **Bubble Sort**
4. **Selection Sort**
5. **N-Queen Problem**
6. **Tower of Hanoi**

Each algorithm simulation provides a user-friendly interface to interact with and observe how these algorithms work.

## Getting Started

You can run this application in your web browser by following these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-simulator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd algorithm-simulator
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Simulations

### Linear Search

The linear search simulation allows you to search for a specific element within an array using a linear search algorithm. You can input the array and the target element to search for.

### Binary Search

The binary search simulation demonstrates how the binary search algorithm works on a sorted array. You can input the sorted array and the element you want to search for.

### Bubble Sort

The bubble sort simulation visualizes the classic bubble sort algorithm. You can input an unsorted array and observe the step-by-step sorting process.

### Selection Sort

The selection sort simulation shows how the selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element. You can input an unsorted array and watch the sorting process.

### N-Queen Problem

The N-Queen problem simulation helps you understand how to solve the N-Queen puzzle by placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard without any queens threatening each other.

### Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi simulation illustrates the classic Tower of Hanoi problem, where you have to move a stack of disks from one rod to another while adhering to the rules of the puzzle.

## How to Use

1. Select the algorithm you want to simulate from the navigation menu.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the required parameters for the selected algorithm.

3. Start the simulation to visualize the algorithm's execution step by step.

4. Observe and learn how the algorithm works and how it achieves its goal.
